vzip - Vlad's zip

  vzip is a simple compression program that works by compressing 8 MiB chunks
using huffman encoding. It compresses the 5458199 byte
"examples/shakespeare.txt" file down to 3272382 bytes or ~60% of the original
size. For reference, zip compresses the same file down to 2022556 bytes or 37%
of the original size.

=== USAGE ===

  This code was written on a Macbook, but it should work on linux and
ARM as well. To build the program, run "./build.sh release". The resulting
executable will be "build/vzip".

  To compress a file, run "vzip compress INPUT OUTPUT" where INPUT is the file
you wish to compress and OUTPUT is where the compressed file will be output.

  To decompress a file, run "vzip compress INPUT OUTPUT" where INPUT is a file
compressed by vzip and OUTPUT is where you want the original file.

=== Limitations ===

  There is no hash to check the integrity of the result, however offsets of
serialized huffman trees are verified to prevent undefined behavior.

  The implementation is completely unoptimized. It is single-threaded and
does not make use of useful x86_64 extensions like AVX-512 to speed up
encoding/decoding.
